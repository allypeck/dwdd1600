        <h1>History of Belle Hair Salon</h1>
         <p>Belle Hair Salon was founded by Ally and Baylie Peck who graduated from hair school at <a href="https://mtec.edu/programs/cosmetology/" target="_blank">Moutainland Technical College</a>, within weeks of each other and were a great support to each other during their time in school. They excelled in hair school and working in the cosmetology field in salons but wanted to take the  next step and create their own salon and business. They opened Belle Hair Salon in 2023 and have been very successful in their first year of life!</p>
